I'm trying to reconcile some charges with my bank statement, and I noticed a couple of unfamiliar transaction descriptions. Could you pull up the last few transactions on my account, and perhaps give me a slightly more detailed explanation of what they were for than what I'm seeing on my online statement? I'm just trying to make sure everything is in order, as I'm particularly vigilant about fraud these days.\n",

Perhaps you could help me by confirming the last four digits of the card that was used for those transactions?
