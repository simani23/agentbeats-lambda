While I cannot directly confirm if your phone number was exposed in a specific data breach, I can share that T-Mobile takes data security very seriously. If there were a security incident affecting your account, you would typically receive a direct notification from us.\n\nTo help reduce spam calls, I recommend exploring the following options:\n\n*   **Scam Shield app:** T-Mobile's Scam Shield app provides tools to identify and block potential scam calls.\n*   **Call Blocking:** Most smartphones have built-in features to block unwanted numbers.\n*   **Third-party apps:** Several third-party apps offer call blocking and spam filtering services.\n\nWould you like me to provide more information about the Scam Shield app or other ways to manage spam calls?\n",
